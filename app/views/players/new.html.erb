<h2>New Account</h2>
<!-- Notes
1.) Note about :name attribute
    For now, the name will be entered and searched for within backend to check for existence as a player. If player name does not exist, reroute to create player account page, else add username/password to player instance

    Future update might include a searchable text-box to find an exisiting player name without an account yet. And may require some form of identity verification to make sure the person creating the account is actually that player they choose

2.) Note about :username attribute
    Username must be unique
